# qresExtract: Qt binary resource (qres) extractor

A simple program that can extract qres binary resource files generated by the Qt Resource Compiler `rcc`.

Such files can be detected with
```
$ xxd -g 1 -l 4 test.bin
00000000: 71 72 65 73                                      qres
```

Usage:
```
./qresExtract <resource.bin> [output path]
```

Output path is optional. If none is specified, then the resource will be extracted to the current working directory.
A subdirectory is created for the resource to be extracted.

Inside it, a matching qrc is also generated which can be used with Qt's `rcc` resource compiler to recreate a new binary resource.

Example:
```
$ ./qresExtract test.bin
/test.txt
/test2.txt

$ cat test/test.txt
Hello,

$ cat test/test2.txt
World!
```

Requires Qt5: `qt5-default` (or equivalent)

Compile with:
```
$ qmake && make
```
